"Plays" [hashle](https://www.csh.rit.edu/~ethanf108/hashle/)

guess a word ("chom" is a good choice), copy the webpage's html (just needs the div with the the hash in it, but the entire page works) 

paste the html into the variable name html and run `cargo run`. it will print out possible correct answer(s) (probably only one)
